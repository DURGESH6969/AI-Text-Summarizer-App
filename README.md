# AI-Text-Summarizer-App

Welcome to my project-based learning journey! In this repository, I present an AI-powered text summarizer web app that I built from scratch. 
This project has helped me develop valuable skills in web development, API integration, and application deployment. 
I believe it demonstrates my ability to tackle real-world challenges and showcases my dedication to continuous learning.

## Project Overview

In this project, I've created a user-friendly text summarization application using Node.js, Replit, the Hugging Face Inference API, and Postman.
The application's core functionality is to summarize text using AI. I've not only integrated an API but also customized the app to make it unique and engaging.

## Duration

This project took me approximately 4-6 hours to complete as a beginner. It was an intensive yet rewarding learning experience.

## Prerequisites

To successfully recreate this project, you should have:

- Access to a computer with internet connectivity.
